This mod adds new stone and wood blocks for construction and decoration, a dye system for making colours is used to craft blocks. I have also added a glowstone in a similar vain to glowglass from the moreblocks mod.
Although not dependant, if you wish to craft these blocks you will need the ‘Flowers’ mod (to create dyes) and the ‘More Blocks’ mod (only used for crafting coloured stone squares).
Flowers can be crafted into (4) dyes:
Roses = Pink
Yellow dandelions = Yellow
White dandelions = White
Tulips = Orange
Violas = Purple
Waterlilies = Blue (Not the best choice but I was a bit stuck for blue)
In addition apples and cacti produce red and green, coal now produces black dye.
Red, Yellow and Blue dyes can be mixed in combinations (one above the other) to produce Orange, Green and Purple (1).

Wooden blocks and cobble blocks are crafted the same way you just need to substitute stone for wood/cobble in the recipes.
